# Adventures-Works-Complete-report-Power bi
<p>In my Adventure Works data visualization project, I performed in-depth analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) to 
identify trends and patterns in the company's sales and customer behavior. </p>

<p>One of the main focus of my project was product-based analysis, where I examined sales data to identify top-selling 
products, analyze product trends over time, and explore relationships between products and customer demographics. I 
also conducted customer-based analysis to understand customer behavior.</p>
<p>Overall, my project demonstrated my ability to work with complex data sets and apply analytical skills to gain insights and 
inform business decisions.<p/>
